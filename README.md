📚 Library Management System (Java)

Overview

The Library Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage library operations such as book management, user management, and borrow/return transactions. The project focuses on applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, proper exception handling, and efficient data management using collections and file/database storage.

In addition to development, the project emphasizes software testing best practices, including manual testing, static testing, automated UI testing, and API testing, with full test activity tracking using Jira.

Key Features

Manage books (add, update, delete, search)

Manage library users

Borrow and return books with validation rules

Track book availability and loan status

Exception handling for invalid operations (e.g. unavailable books, invalid users)

Technical Implementation

Java application following OOP principles

Use of Java Collections Framework for in-memory data handling

File handling and/or database integration (MySQL / SQLite)

Clear separation of concerns (models, services, utilities)

Testing & Quality Assurance

Manual testing

Black-box and white-box test cases

Test plan and test case documentation

Static testing
